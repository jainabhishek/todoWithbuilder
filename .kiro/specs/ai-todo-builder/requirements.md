# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature specification outlines the development of a modern todo list application enhanced with an AI builder functionality. The AI builder allows users to request new features for their todo app through natural language, and the system will automatically implement these features using a multi-agent architecture. This creates a dynamic, extensible todo application that can evolve based on user needs without requiring traditional development processes.

The system leverages Claude Code SDK to provide persistent execution environments for AI agents, enabling them to maintain context, access file systems, and coordinate complex development workflows.

## Recommendations

### Scope Management Recommendations

**R1. Phased Delivery Approach**
- **Recommendation**: Implement the AI builder in 4 distinct phases rather than attempting full functionality immediately
- **Rationale**: The complexity of coordinating 8+ AI agents simultaneously presents significant technical and user experience risks
- **Suggested Phases**:
  - Phase 1: Core todo app + Product Manager agent only
  - Phase 2: Add Designer and Frontend Developer agents
  - Phase 3: Complete agent team with collaboration features
  - Phase 4: Advanced portfolio management and optimization

**R2. User Experience Safeguards**
- **Recommendation**: Add explicit user approval gates for all AI-generated changes
- **Rationale**: Users need control over their application evolution to prevent unwanted modifications
- **Additional Requirements**:
  - User must approve all feature implementations before deployment
  - Provide preview/sandbox mode for testing AI-generated features
  - Enable rollback of any feature within 7 days of installation

**R3. Performance and Cost Considerations**
- **Recommendation**: Define Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for AI agent response times
- **Rationale**: User expectations need to be managed for AI processing times and associated costs
- **Suggested SLAs**:
  - Simple feature requests (priority, tags): < 5 minutes
  - Complex feature requests (search, export): < 30 minutes
  - Major feature requests (custom workflows): < 2 hours

### Enhanced Requirements

**R4. Multi-User Support**
- **Recommendation**: Add requirement for multi-user scenarios and resource management
- **Missing Requirement**: As a user in a shared environment, I want my AI projects to not interfere with other users' projects
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - System SHALL support concurrent AI projects for different users
  - System SHALL prevent resource conflicts between user projects
  - System SHALL provide usage analytics and cost tracking per user

**R5. Emergency Controls**
- **Recommendation**: Add requirement for emergency stop and rollback capabilities
- **Missing Requirement**: As a user, I want emergency controls to stop AI agents and rollback changes if something goes wrong
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - User SHALL have emergency stop button accessible at all times
  - System SHALL support immediate rollback to last known good state
  - System SHALL preserve data integrity during emergency operations

**R6. Transparency and Explainability**
- **Recommendation**: Add requirement for AI decision transparency
- **Missing Requirement**: As a user, I want to understand why AI agents made specific technical decisions
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - AI agents SHALL document decision rationale for all implementations
  - System SHALL provide audit trail of all AI-generated changes
  - User SHALL access agent discussions and reasoning processes

### Validation Recommendations

**R7. Start with Proof of Concept**
- **Recommendation**: Validate core concept with minimal viable implementation before full development
- **Suggested MVP**: Single product manager agent that can add one simple feature (priority levels)
- **Success Criteria**: User can request priority feature, AI implements it correctly, user approves and uses it

**R8. User Testing Strategy**
- **Recommendation**: Implement continuous user feedback loops throughout development
- **Approach**: Beta user program with iterative feedback collection
- **Focus Areas**: AI agent communication clarity, feature request workflow, user control mechanisms
