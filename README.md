npm run setup
npm run dev
```

### **3. Open the Application**
- **Todo App**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **AI Company Console**: [http://localhost:3000/ai-company](http://localhost:3000/ai-company)

## 🤖 **What Makes This Special**

### **AI Development Team**
The application includes 8 specialized AI agents that work together:
- 👔 **Product Manager** - Requirements & planning
- 🎨 **UX Designer** - User experience & design
- 🏗️ **Solutions Architect** - System architecture
- ⚛️ **Frontend Developer** - React/TypeScript UI
- 🔧 **Backend Developer** - APIs & databases  
- 🧪 **QA Engineer** - Testing & quality assurance
- 🚀 **DevOps Engineer** - Infrastructure & deployment
- 📋 **Scrum Master** - Project coordination

### **Natural Language Feature Development**
Simply describe what you want in plain English, and watch as the AI team:
1. 📝 Analyzes your requirements
2. 🎯 Plans the implementation
3. 💻 Writes the code collaboratively
4. ✅ Tests the functionality
5. 🚀 Deploys the feature

### **Real-Time Collaboration**
Watch AI agents communicate, hand off tasks, and coordinate like a real software development team.

## 🛠️ **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis
