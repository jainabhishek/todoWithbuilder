## Architecture

### Core Components

#### ProjectManager
The central orchestrator that manages all project operations:

```typescript
class ProjectManager {
  // Project lifecycle management
  async createProject(params: ProjectParams): Promise<Project>
  async executeProject(projectId: string, phase?: string): Promise<ProjectExecutionContext>
  async stopProjectExecution(projectId: string): Promise<void>
  
  // Agent coordination
  async assignAgents(projectId: string, agentRoles: string[]): Promise<AgentAssignment[]>
  async autoAssignAgents(projectId: string): Promise<AgentAssignment[]>
  
  // Communication and handoffs
  async createProjectThread(projectId: string, topic: string, participants: string[]): Promise<string>
  async requestAgentHandoff(projectId: string, fromAgent: string, toAgent: string, reason: string, taskDescription: string): Promise<string>
  
  // Analytics and monitoring
  getProjectStatistics(): ProjectStatistics
  getProjectHealth(projectId: string): ProjectHealth
  getAgentWorkloads(): AgentWorkload[]
}
```

#### CommunicationManager
Handles all inter-agent communication and coordination:

```typescript
class CommunicationManager {
  // Thread management
  async createThread(topic: string, participants: string[]): Promise<CommunicationThread>
  async sendMessage(threadId: string, from: string, content: unknown): Promise<void>
  
  // Handoff coordination
  async suggestHandoff(fromAgent: string, toAgent: string, reason: string, context: unknown, taskDescription: string): Promise<HandoffRequest>
  async acceptHandoff(handoffId: string): Promise<void>
  async rejectHandoff(handoffId: string, reason: string): Promise<void>
  
  // Collaboration facilitation
  async facilitateCollaboration(initiator: string, collaborators: string[], task: string): Promise<CommunicationThread>
}
```

#### SubAgentManager
Manages specialized AI agents and their configurations:

```typescript
class SubAgentManager {
  // Agent management
  async createSubAgent(config: SubAgentConfig): Promise<void>
  async delegateTask(agentName: string, taskDescription: string): Promise<TaskResult>
  
  // Communication
  async sendMessage(message: SubAgentMessage): Promise<void>
  async handleHandoff(fromAgent: string, toAgent: string, context: unknown, taskDescription: string): Promise<TaskResult>
}
```

The system includes 8 specialized AI agents, each with specific roles and capabilities:

1. **Product Manager** - Requirements analysis and user story creation
2. **UX Designer** - UI/UX design and user experience optimization
3. **Solutions Architect** - System architecture and technical design decisions
4. **Frontend Developer** - React/TypeScript frontend development
5. **Backend Developer** - Node.js/Express API development and database operations
6. **QA Engineer** - Testing and quality assurance
7. **DevOps Engineer** - Infrastructure, deployment, and CI/CD pipeline management
8. **Scrum Master** - Project coordination and agile process facilitation

const project = await projectManager.createProject({
  title: 'Priority System Feature',
  description: 'Add priority levels to todo items',
  userRequest: 'I want to set priority levels for my todos',
  priority: 'medium'
});

// 2. Auto-assign appropriate agents
const assignments = await projectManager.autoAssignAgents(project.id);

// 3. Execute the project
const executionContext = await projectManager.executeProject(project.id);

// 4. Monitor progress
const progress = await projectManager.getProjectProgressWithCoordination(project.id);
```
